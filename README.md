A card game I created for Code Fellows' Foundations I class in Seattle, WA.

It is currently just a simple, one-button game of War, which keeps track of a deck of cards randomly dealt to a player and computer.  On button presses, the top card of each players' cards are compared, and the winner takes the cards.

It is still a work-in-progress, with many parts of the UI yet to be fleshed out.
